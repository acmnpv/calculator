# Summary of the tool #
#######################

This tool is a very simple way to evaluate the force between two particles,
at user given coordinates and with a user selected force function.

###################################
# Installation and file structure #
###################################

The tool requires CMake (at least version 3.16 is what I chose as the minimum)
to configure the build and a C++17 compliant compiler to be build. In addition,
the command line parser utility library needs to be fetched using Conan, at least
version .

To install, pull from github (git clone github.com/acmnpv/forcecalculator.git),
create a build directory 

   mkdir build
   cd build

And then, from this new directory, run CMake with default settings

   cmake ../forcecalculator

Followed by a normal invocation of make to compile and link the executable

   make -j

Tests can be run using ctest

   ctest -DExperimentalTest --output-on-failure

The tool will be placed in the build folder and can then be used as is on the system.
